🚑 Ambulance Detection System – Deep Learning Web App Deployment

This project is an end-to-end Ambulance Detection System built using PyTorch and deployed as a live web application using Streamlit Cloud. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Deep Learning and Computer Vision can be applied to detect emergency vehicles from images, which can contribute to smart traffic management and automated monitoring systems.

The model is trained to classify images and identify whether an ambulance is present. The trained model has been optimized and integrated into an interactive Streamlit application, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions instantly through a user-friendly interface.

This project covers the complete Machine Learning workflow — from model development and optimization to GitHub integration and cloud deployment.
